# Module 1 Final Project

This project focuses on modeling multivariate regression using the kings county housing dataset found in the repo. The data is cleaned, explored, engineered, and modeled. The point of this project was to predict housing prices as accurately as possible using the available data.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is run the student.ipynb file in a jupyter notebook and it should run

## Files

student.ipynb - This is the main code file. This has all of the working models and is commented.

student-Copy3.ipynb - was an interesting test I ran using all zipcodes as categorical variables which gave a surprisingly high adjusted r-   squared

Presentation.pdf - A non-technical presentation

kc_house_data.csv - contains all the data for the project
